# IGI-SYN-SEQ synthetic multi-assay tumor datasets: design specification

Status: draft v0.2 (2026-09-24); defaults marked **[default]** were accepted by the owner on 2026-09-24 (see Decisions log). Owner: Steven Vensko. Generator repo: `~/dev/igi-syn-seq`.
Decisions marked **[default]** were delegated and can be overridden before generation starts.

## 0. Decisions log

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-24 | All **[default]** choices below accepted (tumor architectures, catalog counts, 4,000-cell composition, depths, ~700 GB per full release pair). |
| 2026-09-24 | Tumor expression baseline: TCGA-BRCA basal-like samples (PanCanAtlas `Subtype_mRNA = Basal`, 193 samples, 191 present in the UCSC Xena Toil kallisto transcript-TPM table) rather than a new salmon run. |
| 2026-09-24 | ERV tumor-specific vs tumor-associated labels use the pan-normal reference shipped with lens-v2.0.0-dev-alt (`pan_normal_and_mtec_exp.95th_perc.homo_sapiens.quant.sf` and `erv_pep_exp_norm_and_mtec.homo_sapiens.tsv`) for now. |
| 2026-09-24 | IGI-SYN-SEQ-02 phasing: WhatsHap read-backed blocks scaffolded by SHAPEIT5 statistical phasing (1000 Genomes GRCh38 panel). |
| 2026-09-24 | Germline SVs are part of both baselines: Q100 `stvar` calls >= 50 bp for HG002 (~46,500, TRF-annotated by GIAB); for IPISRC044 a short-read caller on the normal WGS (Manta proposed, pending), since the IPISRC044 "ONT" data turned out to be single-cell cDNA, not genomic; both annotated for gene overlap and predicted consequence. |

## 1. Goals

- A fully synthetic, fully known-truth human tumor/normal dataset that exercises every LENS
  antigen source (SNV, InDel, fusion, SV, CTA/self, viral, ERV, splice) across every assay LENS
  consumes, including long-read and single-cell.
- Variants span a **spectrum of evidence** so the dataset serves both as positive control
  ("flagpost" events) and for setting detection thresholds (VAF, depth, expression,
  allelic expression, binding, sequence context, clonality).
- Every event is reflected consistently in every assay in which it is physically observable.
- Tumor architecture modeled on **triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)**.
- A full-genome release plus a **chr1to6 subset** that mirrors the full release but runs fast.

## 2. Dataset naming and layout

Two independent datasets share one catalog design (the IGI-SYN-SEQ family) but differ in
germline baseline and tumor architecture. Each is its own RAFT dataset with its own manifest:

| Dataset | Germline baseline | Sex | Architecture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IGI-SYN-SEQ-01` | HG002 (GIAB Q100 phased assembly calls) | male | diploid, purity 0.70, no WGD, HRD (SBS3) |
| `IGI-SYN-SEQ-02` | IPISRC044 (public; called + phased here) | male | WGD, purity 0.45, APOBEC-dominated |

Both baselines are male. TNBC in a male host is biologically unusual but has no simulation
cost; the benefit is that HG002 is the PacBio reference sample (public Revio HiFi WGS, Kinnex
bulk, Kinnex sc + matched 10x 5' Illumina) which is what makes accurate long-read error models
possible. If a female baseline is later wanted, HG004 (HG002's mother, GIAB trio-phased) is a
drop-in swap of the baseline VCF only. **[default: keep HG002 and IPISRC044]**

Each dataset has two releases: `full` and `chr1to6`. Manifest values, using `IGI-SYN-SEQ-01`
as the example: `Dataset` = `IGI-SYN-SEQ-01` or `IGI-SYN-SEQ-01-chr1to6`; `Patient_Name` =
`IGI-SYN-SEQ-01` (one synthetic patient per dataset).

RAFT workspace placement (relative to the RAFT workspace root, `$RAFT`), per dataset:

```
inputs/fastqs/IGI-SYN-SEQ-01/<full|chr1to6>/   Illumina FASTQs (WES T/N, bulk RNA, 10x GEX, 10x TCR)
inputs/bams/IGI-SYN-SEQ-01/<full|chr1to6>/     PacBio unaligned BAMs (+ .pbi) and derived FASTQs
inputs/metadata/IGI-SYN-SEQ-01/                manifests, truth bundle, design tables, README
```

## 3. Samples per dataset

| Sample | Assay | Platform | Depth / size [default] | Delivered as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tumor WES | WES, hg38_exome.bed | Illumina PE150 | 150x on-target | FASTQ R1/R2 |
| normal WES | WES | Illumina PE150 | 100x | FASTQ |
| tumor bulk RNA | RNA-Seq, polyA, stranded | Illumina PE150 | 80 M pairs | FASTQ |
| tumor WGS | HiFi WGS | PacBio Revio | 30x | `*.hifi_reads.bam` + `.pbi` + FASTQ |
| normal WGS | HiFi WGS | PacBio Revio | 30x | same |
| tumor Kinnex bulk RNA | Kinnex full-length (MAS 8-mer array) | PacBio Revio | 15 M segmented reads | pre-skera `hifi_reads.bam` **and** post-skera `segmented.bam` |
| tumor Kinnex scRNA | Kinnex single-cell (MAS 16-mer), 10x 5' v2 cDNA | PacBio Revio | 4,000 cells, ~12 M segmented reads | pre-skera + post-skera BAMs |
| tumor 10x 5' GEX | scRNA-Seq 5' v2 | Illumina | 4,000 cells, ~40k reads/cell | FASTQ (Cell Ranger naming) |
| tumor 10x 5' TCR | scTCR-Seq V(D)J | Illumina | ~5k reads/cell | FASTQ |

The Kinnex sc, 10x GEX and 10x TCR libraries derive from the same 4,000 cells and share
barcodes and UMIs (independent molecule sampling from a common per-cell molecule pool).
No normal RNA. LENS v2.0.0-dev-alt enters Kinnex sc at the segmented-BAM stage
(`lens.nf` line ~58), so the segmented BAM is the LENS input and the pre-skera BAM is for
validating skera itself.

Storage estimate (full, both datasets): ~700 GB, dominated by four 30x HiFi BAMs.

## 4. Germline baselines

- **IGI-SYN-SEQ-01 / HG002**: hg38-projected phased diploid VCF from the HPRC/GIAB HG002 assembly
  (SNV + indel + SV), plus HG002 HLA alleles from clinical typing, trio-phased and concordant with
  the diploid assembly (Chin et al. 2020, Nat Commun 11:4794, Supplementary Table 4):
  maternal A*01:01:01G, B*35:08:01G, C*04:01:01G, DRB1*10:01:01G, DQA1*01:01:01G, DQB1*05:01:01G;
  paternal A*26:01:01G, B*38:01:01G, C*12:03:01G, DRB1*04:02:01, DQA1*03:01:01G, DQB1*03:02:01G.
  Manifest `Alleles` (class I, two-field): HLA-A*01:01,HLA-A*26:01,HLA-B*35:08,HLA-B*38:01,HLA-C*04:01,HLA-C*12:03.
  The HLA LOH event in section 5.1 removes the paternal haplotype (A*26:01/B*38:01/C*12:03).
- **IGI-SYN-SEQ-02 / IPISRC044**: LENS's germline VCFs are exome-restricted, so a genome-wide set is
  built here: DeepVariant (WGS model) on the blood-normal Illumina WGS, then SHAPEIT5 statistical phasing
  (1000G GRCh38 panel) scaffolded by WhatsHap read-backed blocks. IPISRC044 has **no long-read DNA**: the
  "ONT" files are ONT sequencing of the T1 10x 5' single-cell cDNA library (polyA, 10x adapters, median
  read 291 bp), so read-backed phasing comes from short reads only and SHAPEIT5 carries the genome-wide
  phase. Germline SVs must come from a short-read caller on the normal WGS (Manta proposed), annotated
  for gene overlap. Procedure: `baseline-references.md`. HLA from manifest: A*01:01 hom, B*08:01/B*27:05, C*01:02/C*07:01.
- A pathogenic **BRCA1** germline frameshift is added to both baselines (TNBC/HRD
  realism; wild-type allele lost somatically, section 5).
- Germline variants are also deliberately placed in a subset of CTA and ERV ORFs
  (section 6) to exercise germline-aware peptide generation.

## 5. Tumor architecture (TNBC)

Shared driver logic, dataset-specific parameters.

### 5.1 IGI-SYN-SEQ-01 / HG002 (purity 0.70, ploidy ~2.3, no WGD)

Clone tree: `T` (truncal, CCF 1.0) -> `A` (CCF 0.40) -> `A1` (CCF 0.12, nested in A);
`B` (CCF 0.25, sibling of A). Sum of sibling CCFs 0.65 <= 1.

| Clone | Drivers / arm events |
|---|---|
| T | TP53 R248Q + 17p LOH; RB1 frameshift + 13q LOH; PTEN homozygous focal deletion (SV, 10q23); BRCA1 wild-type allele lost (17q LOH); MYC 8q24 focal amp CN 12; 1q gain CN 3; 5q loss; 8p loss; 16q loss; HLA LOH on 6p (loses one haplotype: A*26:01/B*38:01/C*12:03); chromothripsis on 5p (~60 breakpoints); HRD tandem-duplication phenotype (~100 TDs, 1-10 kb, genome-wide) |
| A | PIK3CA H1047R; EGFR focal amp CN 8 |
| A1 | NF1 frameshift |
| B | KMT2C nonsense; one private in-frame fusion |

Signatures: SBS3 0.60, SBS1 0.15, SBS5 0.15, SBS13 0.10; indels ID6-dominated
(deletions with microhomology). Background genome-wide burden ~1 mut/Mb
(~3,000 SNV, ~300 indel), almost all non-coding.

Expected VAF tiers at purity 0.70: truncal LOH region ~0.54, truncal amplified (MYC
region) up to ~0.8, truncal het ~0.35, clone A ~0.14, clone B ~0.09, clone A1 ~0.04.

### 5.2 IGI-SYN-SEQ-02 / IPISRC044 (purity 0.45, WGD, ploidy ~3.6)

Same clone topology with four clones (T, A, A1, B) at CCF 1.0 / 0.35 / 0.10 / 0.30.
Drivers: TP53 frameshift + LOH (pre-WGD, so 0 wild-type copies out of 4 total at the
locus after WGD), RB1 whole-gene deletion, PTEN nonsense + LOH, BRCA1 germline + LOH,
MYC amp CN 20, EGFR amp in A, PIK3CA E545K in T, chromothripsis on chr3p, HLA LOH losing
B*27:05/C*07:01 haplotype. Signatures: SBS2+13 0.50, SBS3 0.20, SBS1+5 0.30; ~4 mut/Mb
background (~12,000 SNV, ~1,200 indel). Post-WGD private mutations have 1 of ~4 copies,
which pushes many events into the low-VAF regime (truncal het post-WGD ~0.12).

Tumor-in-normal contamination: 0 % **[default off; parameter available]**.

## 6. Designed variant catalog

### 6.1 Evidence-spectrum axes

Every designed event carries a tier label on each axis in the truth bundle.

| Axis | Tiers |
|---|---|
| clonality | T-LOH, T-amp, T-het, A, B, A1 |
| expression (gene TPM) | 0, ~1, ~10, ~100, ~1000 |
| allelic expression of mutant allele | balanced 0.5, silenced 0.1, dominant 0.9 (subset only) |
| MHC-I binding (patient HLA, netMHCpan %rank) | strong <=0.5, weak 0.5-2, non >2 |
| sequence context | clean-unique; homopolymer >=6; low-mappability/segdup; within 30 bp of germline het; somatic pair within one codon or <=150 bp; exon edge (<=10 bp from capture boundary); deep intronic/UTR (WGS-only) |
| capture | WES on-target vs off-target |

**Flagpost** = truncal, LOH/amplified (VAF >= 0.5), TPM >= 100, balanced, strong binder,
clean context, exon center. ~40 flagposts across all classes.

### 6.2 Counts per dataset

| Class | Designed count | Composition |
|---|---|---|
| SNV, missense core grid | 300 | 6 clonality x 5 expression x 3 binding cells, ~3-4 replicates each, clean context |
| SNV, missense context strata | 150 | 6 context strata x 25 |
| SNV, nonsense | 60 | incl. NMD-escape (last exon) vs NMD-sensitive |
| SNV, synonymous | 40 | negatives; a few create cryptic splice sites (count under splice) |
| SNV, start-loss / stop-loss | 20 | |
| SNV, hotspot flagposts | 12 | TP53 R248Q/R273H, PIK3CA H1047R/E545K, KRAS G12D, BRAF V600E, IDH1 R132H, etc. |
| InDel, frameshift del / ins | 80 / 60 | lengths 1-10, long tail 11-50; neo-ORF lengths span 1-60 aa |
| InDel, in-frame del / ins | 40 / 30 | |
| InDel, homopolymer context | 40 | PacBio-hard indels |
| Gene fusions | 20 | 4 flagposts; in-frame 10, out-of-frame 4, 5'UTR-CDS 2, promoter-swap 2, read-through with no DNA breakpoint 2 (tumor-associated); mechanisms TRA 8 / DEL 4 / INV 4 / DUP 2 / none 2; 8 with breakpoint inside a captured exon +-50 bp (WES-visible), 3 reciprocal; clonality 12 T / 5 A / 2 B / 1 A1 |
| SVs (non-fusion designed) | 100 | DEL 25 (50 bp-5 Mb log-spaced), DUP 20, INV 15, TRA 15, INS 15 (10 L1/Alu/SVA MEIs, 5 novel sequence), complex 10; 50 land in coding sequence: exon-deleting in-frame 15, out-of-frame 15, whole-gene loss 10, intragenic exon dup 10 |
| SVs, structured background | ~160 | chromothripsis cluster (~60) + HRD tandem dups (~100) |
| Viruses | 3 | HPV16 integrated at 8q24 inside the MYC amplicon, E6/E7 expressed, host-virus fusion transcript, junction visible in WGS/RNA and off-target WES; EBV episomal ~5 copies/cell, low expression, plus trace 0.05 copies/cell in the blood normal (realistic negative); HPV18 episomal in clone B only, unexpressed |
| CTAs | 15 | 5 expression tiers x 3; 4 carry germline coding variants, 3 carry somatic missense, 2 restricted to clone A (single-cell heterogeneity) |
| ERVs | 30 | 10 tumor-specific (absent in pan-normal panel), 10 tumor-associated (low in normals), 10 unexpressed negatives; 12 with germline ORF variants, 5 with somatic variants, 5 with no annotated CDS (ORF-fallback path) |
| Splice variants | 30 | tumor-specific 15 = somatic splice-site/cryptic variants causing exon skip 5, intron retention 3, cryptic 5' 3, cryptic 3' 2, novel exon 2; tumor-associated 15 = annotated isoform switch 10 + novel junction with no DNA cause 5 |
| Negative controls | ~110 | 30 low-depth germline hets that mimic somatic; 30 A>I RNA-editing sites (RNA-only); 20 processed-pseudogene parent mismatches; 10 germline variants in CTA/ERV; 20 somatic SNVs in unexpressed genes |

Totals per dataset: ~620 designed coding SNVs, ~250 designed indels, 20 fusions,
~260 SVs, 3 viruses, 15 CTAs, 30 ERVs, 30 splice events, plus signature-driven background.
Coding burden is ~10x a real TNBC by design.

### 6.3 Placement rules

- >= 50 % of every class and every tier cell placed on chr1to6 so the subset preserves the
  spectrum. HLA (6p) and IGK (2p) are inside the subset; TRA/TRB/TRG (chr14/7) are not.
- Fusion partners chosen from LENS's fusion reference where possible plus novel pairs.
- CTA and ERV loci drawn from `references/homo_sapiens/cta_self` and the HERV annotation in
  `gencode.v37.annotation.with.hervs.gtf`.
- Peptide binding evaluated against each patient's HLA with netMHCpan (and mhcflurry as
  a second opinion) at design time; the truth bundle records both.

## 7. Cross-assay reflection matrix

| Event class | WES T | WES N | bulk RNA | HiFi WGS T | HiFi WGS N | Kinnex bulk | Kinnex sc | 10x GEX | 10x TCR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| somatic SNV/indel (exonic) | yes | no | yes if expressed, ASE-weighted | yes, phased | no | yes if expressed | per cell, clone-restricted | per cell (5' bias) | no |
| somatic SNV/indel (deep intronic) | off-target only | no | intron retention only | yes | no | no | no | no | no |
| germline variants | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| CNA / LOH / HLA LOH | depth + BAF | baseline | ASE, dosage | depth + BAF, phased | baseline | dosage | dosage per cell (scevan) | dosage per cell | no |
| fusion (with DNA breakpoint) | if breakpoint captured | no | chimeric reads | split/spanning reads | no | full-length chimeric | per cell | 5'-end chimeric | no |
| read-through fusion | no | no | yes | no | no | yes | yes | yes | no |
| SV | if breakpoint captured | no | if transcribed | yes | no | if transcribed | if transcribed | rarely | no |
| virus integrated | off-target | no | host-virus + viral transcripts | junction + viral reads | no | yes | yes | yes | no |
| virus episomal | off-target | trace EBV | yes | yes | trace EBV | yes | yes | yes | no |
| CTA / ERV expression | germline vars only | germline vars only | yes | germline vars only | germline vars only | yes | per cell | per cell | no |
| splice (somatic-caused) | causal variant | no | junction | causal variant | no | full-length isoform | per cell | 5' only | no |
| splice (associated) | no | no | junction | no | no | full-length isoform | per cell | 5' only | no |
| TCR clonotypes | no | no | TRA/TRB reads at bulk level | germline loci | germline loci | some TCR transcripts | some TCR transcripts | 5' TCR reads | yes |

## 8. Single-cell design (4,000 cells)

Composition **[default]**: tumor 35 % (split by clone: T-only 35 %, A 40 %, A1 12 % of A,
B 25 % of tumor cells, so per-cell genotypes reproduce the CCFs), CD8 T 18 % (exhausted,
effector, memory), CD4 T 9 %, Treg 3 %, B 5 %, plasma 3 %, macrophage/monocyte 12 %,
DC 2 %, CAF 8 %, endothelial 4 %, NK 1 %. Doublets 6 %, ambient RNA 3 %.
10x 5' v2 chemistry (16 bp barcode from `737K-august-2016.txt`, 10 bp UMI, TSO),
matching `references/single_cell/10x_5prime_v2_pacbio_kinnex`.

TCR: ~1,200 T cells with productive paired alpha/beta (10 % alpha-dual), ~300 clonotypes,
power-law expansion (top 10 clonotypes hold ~30 % of T cells); 5 flagpost clonotypes
mapped in the truth bundle to specific flagpost neoantigens.

Tumor cells' expression reflects CNA dosage (for scevan) and clone-restricted CTAs.

## 9. Expression baseline

Tumor-cell expression baseline: the median transcript-level TPM across TCGA-BRCA basal-like
tumors (PanCanAtlas `Subtype_mRNA = Basal`; 191 of 193 samples are in the UCSC Xena Toil
`tcga_Kallisto_tpm` table, GENCODE v23 transcript IDs, log2(TPM+0.001)). Transcript IDs are
mapped to the LENS annotation (GENCODE v37) by stable ENST ID, dropping version suffixes;
transcripts absent from v23 inherit their gene's mean. A single sample is not used because
the goal is a plausible basal-like profile, not a specific patient. Immune/stromal cell-type
profiles come from the IPISRC044 UCSF SCG1 data (real 10x 5' TME). Designed events override
the baseline for their genes (expression tier).

## 10. Read simulation and error models

| Assay | Simulator | Error/quality model source |
|---|---|---|
| Illumina WES/WGS-style | ART (art_illumina) with custom profiles + fragment model; GC bias and capture efficiency from real IPISRC044 WES | `art_profiler_illumina` on IPISRC044 WES reads |
| Illumina bulk RNA | molecule sampler (per-haplotype, per-clone transcriptome) -> fragmentation -> ART | IPISRC044 RNA reads; positional 3' bias fitted from real data |
| 10x 5' GEX / TCR | custom molecule sampler writing R1 (BC+UMI+TSO) and R2 with ART qualities | IPISRC044 SCG1/TCR reads |
| PacBio HiFi WGS | pbsim3 (quality-score model, multi-pass -> ccs) | HG002 Revio HiFi public data |
| Kinnex bulk / sc | pbsim3 transcript mode on full-length molecules + MAS-Seq adapter concatenation (8-mer / 16-mer arrays), 10x 5' cDNA structure, polyA | HG002 Kinnex bulk and Kinnex sc public data (dataset inventory already in `inputs/metadata/PacBio_Kinnex_scRNA_HG002_10x5p_2024`, files not yet downloaded) |

PacBio outputs are written as unaligned BAM with Revio-style read names, `RG`/`PU`,
and HiFi tags (`np`, `rq`, `ec`), indexed with `pbindex`; skera is run to produce the
segmented BAM so the delivered pair is exactly what a Revio run yields.

All simulators run from containers (none are installed on the cluster; only wgsim,
samtools and bcftools are on PATH). Workload runs under SLURM.

## 11. Truth bundle (`inputs/metadata/IGI-SYN-SEQ-01/truth/`, likewise for -02)

- `germline.phased.vcf.gz` (SNV/indel/SV) with haplotype IDs.
- `somatic.vcf.gz` with INFO: clone, CCF, expected VAF per assay, tier labels, flagpost flag,
  chr1to6 flag, neoantigen peptides and binding ranks.
- `cna.seg` (per clone, per haplotype copy number), `hla_loh.tsv`.
- `sv.bedpe`, `fusions.tsv`, `viral_integrations.tsv`, `viral_copy_number.tsv`.
- `novel_isoforms.gtf` + `splice_events.tsv` (specific vs associated, mechanism).
- `erv_expression.tsv`, `cta_expression.tsv` (with tier and germline/somatic variant flags).
- `expression.tumor_bulk.tsv` (expected TPM per transcript per clone and mixed).
- `cells.tsv` (barcode, cell type, clone, doublet flag), `clonotypes.tsv` (barcode, TRA/TRB CDR3,
  V/J, flagpost antigen link), `negatives.tsv`.
- `manifests/` : LENS manifests for full and chr1to6, with HLA alleles filled.
- `design.yaml`, `seed.txt`, generator version.

## 12. chr1to6 subset

Derived from the full release by alignment, not re-simulated:
- Keep read pairs/molecules whose alignment overlaps chr1to6, plus all viral-contig and
  unmapped reads, plus mates.
- 10x GEX and Kinnex sc keep all barcodes but only chr1to6 molecules (Cell Ranger cell calling
  still works at ~35 % of the UMI depth; documented).
- **10x TCR is kept complete** because TRA/TRB/TRG lie outside chr1to6.
- Truth bundle filtered to chr1to6 events; manifests regenerated.

## 13. Generator pipeline

Nextflow DSL2 in `~/dev/igi-syn-seq`, containerized, seeded, parameterized by `design.yaml`
(so a different catalog or baseline can be regenerated). Stages:

0. `baseline`: fetch/construct phased germline per dataset.
1. `catalog`: seeded catalog design (Python): pick loci per tier, evaluate peptides with
   netMHCpan/mhcflurry, emit truth tables.
2. `genomes`: per-clone, per-haplotype genome FASTAs with CNA multiplicities and SVs;
   viral contigs and integrations.
3. `transcriptomes`: per-clone haplotype-aware transcript sets with designed isoforms,
   fusions, ERVs, CTAs, and expression vectors.
4. `simulate`: per-assay read simulation with clone/purity mixing.
5. `package`: BAM/FASTQ naming, pbindex, skera, manifests, README.
6. `subset`: chr1to6 derivation.
7. `validate`: align back, check VAF/depth/expression against truth, run Cell Ranger and
   skera/lima/isoseq dry-runs, run LENS chr1to6 end to end.

## 14. Open items

- Obtain a Kinnex single-cell read set (UCSF raw T1 BAM preferred; ENA LongBench as fallback).
- Cell Ranger for validating the 10x outputs: run from the community-built nf-core image
  (`quay.io/nf-core/cellranger:9.0.1`; 10.0.0 also available) under singularity, with the 10x GRCh38 2024-A
  GEX and 7.1.0 V(D)J references. 10x's EULA governs use; the image is not redistributed by us.
